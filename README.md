### Hi! 👋

I'm Saranya, a data analyst 📊  who is passionate about Mathematics, Probability & Statistics and who loves to do programming. My passion for software lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true. I always love what I do and take great care of quality in things I build.

💼 Love to work :)

💬 Happy to help!

With almost 6 years of experience in Mainframe technology and few years of busy parenting, am very excited to see the development and open-source community. I also learned a lot from it and I love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happened through open-source. Data Analysis and Data Science gave me a great chance of connecting my love for Mathematics and Statistics again with Programming. 💜
